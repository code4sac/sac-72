# Development Environment Setup

In most cases you will not need to setup a development environment for this application. The only reason to go through the following steps would be if you wanted to customize your site beyond what you can set with the Content Editor.

## Prerequisites

To setup the application you will need:

* PostgreSQL database
* Ruby 1.9.3-p448
* Bundler gem
* Bower


### PostgreSQL installation

#### Linux

    $ sudo apt-get -y install postgresql

#### Mac OS X

    $ brew install postgresql

### Ruby Installation

#### Rbenv

To install ruby, it is necessary to have *rbenv* installed. This can be installed following the steps described in [rbenv's Github Repository](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), in the [Installation Section](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation).

#### Ruby 1.9.3-p448

When rbenv is already installed, go to the project's root folder, and run the following command

```sh
 $ rbenv install
```

### Bundler gem
In order the manage the project dependencies, it is necessary to have installed *bundler*.

```sh
 $ gem install bundler
```

### Bower
To manage the client-side js dependencies, it is necessary to have installed *bower*. *Bower* depends on *node.js*, so if it is not installed yet, install it with *nvm*, following these instructions: [NVM - Installation guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

Having *node.js* installed, run the following command to install *bower*:

```sh
npm install -g bower
```

## Development environment

Before running the app, the following steps should be performed.
* Obtain a copy of the application
* Create the database user for the application
* Install the application dependencies
* Create the database
* Download the client-side dependecies

### Obtain a copy of the application

Clone the code to your computer.
The command you type into your shell application (Terminal on the Mac) will be:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/city72/city-72.git
```

This will create a directory named `city-72`.

### Create the database user for the application

```sh
createuser -P -s city72
```
Assign the word *city72* as password too.

Linux users should run the above command as postgres user (`sudo su postgres`).

### Install the application dependencies

```sh
bundle install
```

### Create the database

```sh
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

### Download the client-side dependencies

```sh
bower install
```

## Run the application locally
With all the prerequisites and the development environment ready. Just run the app, with the following command:

```sh
bundle exec rails s
```

## Open your application on Port 3000

Go to your browser and open 

```sh
localhost:3000
```
